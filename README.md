### **`Othello` a.k.a `Reversi`**
**Othello**, also known as **Reversi**, is a _classic_, _abstract_, _strategy_ board game for two players.
It is played on an `8x8 uncheckered board` with `64 identical game pieces` called _coins_ or _disks_, which have a `light side` and a `dark side`.

# **`How To Play`**

</div>

- **Starting Position**: Four discs, two Black and two White, are placed in the center of the board, forming a diagonal line.
- **Turns**: Players alternate turns. Black moves first.
- **Valid Moves**: A player can place a disc on the board if:
  - There is at least one straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) between the new disc and another disc of the same color.
  - One or more contiguous discs of the opposing color are between them.
- **Capturing**: When a player places a disc, they flip all opposing discs lying on a straight line between the new disc and any anchored discs of the same color.
- **Game End**: The game ends when neither player has a valid move left or the board is completely filled.
